In the context of ethical non-monogamy there is a tendency to contrast and compare differences of relating, especially when beings feel that things could improve. This conversation aims to explore this topic beyond the popular notions of &amp;lsquo;primary&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;secondary&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;hierarchy&amp;rsquo; with the goal to identify the underlying wants and needs, priorities, and choices of individuals in relationships.</description></item><item><title>Relationship Anarchy Workshop</title><link>https://relationship-geeks.github.io/workshops/archive/39c3/workshops/relationship-anarchy-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 12:55:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://relationship-geeks.github.io/workshops/archive/39c3/workshops/relationship-anarchy-workshop/</guid><description>This workshop is based on &amp;ldquo;Relationship Anarchy.
